Hey there, team MyWebClass.org! Welcome to the gang. I'm your CEO Keith, and I'm glad you're here. We're on a mission to help students crush it in the software industry, and I believe we can do it together.

But before we get started, let me tell you a little secret. We don't want to go broke! No one wants to be that person on the street asking for spare change, am I right? And why should we risk it? Do we really want to be the ones missing out on vacations or living in a cardboard box? I don't think so!

So, we need to get to work and save some money. And we're going to do it by finding those sneaky performance bottlenecks that are wasting our precious time and money. Every second we're down or slow is money out the window, and we don't want to waste a single penny.

Plus, think of all the other fun things we can do with that money instead! We could go on team trips, upgrade our office snacks, or even buy a pool table! The possibilities are endless.

So, let's get cracking and evaluate our front-end frameworks, build tools, CSS frameworks, and backend hosting options. And don't forget to estimate how much each user is going to cost us on different hardware setups. We need to be prepared and not get caught off guard.

Thanks for joining the team, everyone. Let's make sure we don't end up homeless, missing out on vacations, or begging for change on the street. Together, we can create something awesome and make a real difference in the software industry.
