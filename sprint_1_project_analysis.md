# Project Requirement Analysis


# Overview.

ey there, MyWebClassers! It's your CEO Keith, and I'm here to talk to you about implementing lean processes and agile project management methodologies. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Oh great, more work for us to do." But trust me, this is going to be a game-changer for our project, and I promise to make it funny!

First off, let's talk about breaking down projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. Think of it like eating a giant pizza. You don't try to shove the whole thing in your mouth at once, right? (Unless you're trying to impress someone, but that's a different story.) Instead, you take small, manageable bites, savoring each delicious slice. That's exactly what we're going to do with our project tasks. We're going to take small, manageable bites, savoring each delicious accomplishment along the way.

And speaking of pizza, let's talk about metrics. Metrics are like the toppings on a pizza. They add flavor and help us measure our progress. We'll be tracking metrics like deployment times, automated test times, and user satisfaction scores. Just like how you measure the amount of cheese on a pizza, we'll measure our progress with these metrics to make sure we're on track to deliver a high-quality product on time and within budget.

Now, let's talk about the tasks themselves. We've identified a set of tasks that are critical for the success of our project. Think of these tasks like toppings on a pizza. Each topping adds flavor and texture to the pizza, just like each task adds value to our project. We'll be conducting legal research, implementing internationalization features, performing SEO research, and making the website accessible to all users. And just like how you might get creative with pizza toppings, we'll be getting creative with our tasks to deliver a website that our users will love.

But don't worry, folks, we're not just throwing a bunch of toppings on a pizza and hoping for the best. We'll be using lean and agile practices to streamline our workflow, increase collaboration and communication, and deliver high-quality work faster. It's like having a well-oiled pizza-making machine, except instead of pizza, we're making a kick-ass website.

In conclusion, adopting lean and agile practices can help us work more efficiently, collaborate more effectively, and deliver better results for our clients. And who doesn't want to deliver a pizza...I mean a website, that's hot, fresh, and ready to be devoured by our users? So let's dig in, MyWebClassers, and make this project a success!

# Assignment Instructions

## Step 1 - Create a rough draft of Themes, Initiatives, and Epics for the project:

### Read the project requirements below and the Project Analysis Scenario Section after these instructions:

Conduct legal research for the website, implement necessary changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
Conduct research and implement internationalization features for the website, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
Conduct SEO research, implement changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
Conduct web accessibility research, implement changes, perform testing and resolve any issues that arise.
Develop a responsive content template and homepage for the website.
Implement GDPR requirements with Google Analytics using Consent API and Javascript.
Develop and perform testing with automated tests that can be used to measure site performance in the browser using Playwright.
Set up a deployment that all members of your team can see to view the progress of the sprint.
Measure deployment times and research ways to improve them and implement measurable improvements.
Measure automated test times and research ways to improve them and implement measurable improvements.
Create easy-to-understand and reliable instructions for installing the project on the developers' Mac or Windows computer.
Create easy-to-understand instructions and scripts to deploy the project and, if necessary, how to set up the development server.
## Step 2 - Break Down Epics into Smaller User Stories:

- Divide the epics into smaller user stories to make it easier to manage the project and track progress.
    - Write down each user story separately.
    - Each Story should be written from the customer or business point of view and consist of one measurable task i.e.
      it can be tested manually or automated

## Step 3 - Prioritize User Stories:

- Determine the importance and urgency of each user story.
- Prioritize the user stories based on their significance and start with the most critical ones.

## Step 4 - Estimate Effort Required:

- Estimate the amount of time and resources needed to complete each user story.
- Note down the estimation for each user story.

## Step 5 - Assign Story Points:

- Assign story points to each user story based on its estimated effort required.
- Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) to assign story points to each user story.

## Step 6 - Define Acceptance Criteria:

- Create a list of acceptance criteria for each user story.
- Clearly define what must be accomplished for each user story to be considered complete.
- Define positive and negative situations such as user entering in wrong data o making a mistake somehow

## Step 7 - Assign the user story to a team member and set a deadline for the task:

- Keep track of the progress of the project regularly.
- Ensure that user stories are being completed on time and according to the defined acceptance criteria.
- If any issues arise, make necessary adjustments to the project plan.
- Set deadlines early, so you have time to account for unexpected situations. Consider using Google Calendar or some
  other way to keep track of time. GitHub Project isn't very good at visualizing this
- Each Team Member is responsible for adding their user stories as issues to the project board in GitHub.
    - Take a screenshot after you load all your tasks into the project board and include it in the project analysis
      report.
## Step 8 - Hold a Sprint Retrospective Meeting or Discuss on the Discussion Board In Canvas
- Discuss how you can improve the requirement analysis and creation of the agile documents for the next sprint

# Submission Instructions
- Create a PowerPoint with your team during a meeting to capture your ideas for the agile documentation.
- All of your project documentation should be added to your repository's wiki see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) for instructions on github wiki.
- Each team member must create a document and include a picture of their tasks after they initially add them to the task board
- Add a link to your project wiki to the document 
- Write a summary of your sprint retrospective for how your can improve this project requirement analysis and documentation writing in the future. 
- Submit the documents to canvas

# Project Analysis Scenario
## Project Introduction: Spoken by the CEO

Hey there, web wizards and tech enthusiasts! As the CEO of MyWebClass.org, I am excited to embark on a journey to create
a website that will knock your socks off! But how do we ensure that we create a website that truly meets the needs of
our users while delivering a top-notch experience? Let me tell you, it all starts with a solid foundation.

By focusing on the design and basic requirements of the website and limiting the use of technology early on, we can
build a foundation that's easier to build upon later. And you know what? We'll be moving at lightning speed through the
early stages of development thanks to static pages that require less technical expertise!

But wait, there's more! We're also adopting a lean methodology that prioritizes the most valuable features and functions
based on user needs. No unnecessary complexity or features that don't add value here! And with the help of our trusty
user feedback, we'll be creating a more user-friendly and effective website.

Now, let's talk project management! We're going agile, baby! And that means we've got some seriously detailed
documentation at each level: themes, initiatives, epics, and user stories. But don't worry, we'll make it fun with some
acceptance criteria to measure if we're meeting our goals and delivering a product that meets your needs.

And we can't forget about story points! These little gems are a way of measuring the complexity of a task or user story,
helping us estimate the effort required to complete the work. It's like a game of difficulty ratings, and we're rating
our legal research user stories at a 5-point task for some moderate complexity and our terms and conditions user stories
at a 3-point task for less complexity.

So there you have it, folks! We're building a solid foundation, prioritizing your needs, and having some fun with our
agile project management. Let's create a website that blows your mind!
